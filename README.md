# TimeChanger
Simple script that changes your profile picture in Telegram into a realtime clock.

# Installation
First of all, you need ```Python3.x```

To install required packages type in terminal/cmd ```pip install -r requirements.txt```, when you are in project folder.

After installation packages you have to get your `api_id` and `api_hash` from https://my.telegram.org/auth and then paste them in ```config.py```. Also you can change your ```session_name```, it will not make anything bad.

Also change my photo at ```resources/photo.png``` with yours :)

# Building & Running
Just run ```main.py``` (```python main.py```) and enjoy.
